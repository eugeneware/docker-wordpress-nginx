# docker-wordpress-nginx

A Dockerfile that installs the latest wordpress, nginx, php-apc and php-fpm.

NB: A big thanks to [jbfink](https://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress) who did most of the hard work on the wordpress parts!

You can check out his [Apache version here](https://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress).

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eugeneware/docker-wordpress-nginx.git
$ cd docker-wordpress-nginx
$ sudo docker build -t="docker-wordpress-nginx" .
```

## Usage

To spawn a new instance of wordpress:

```bash
$ sudo ./run.sh
```

This will tell you the port wordpress is running on, and the directory www & the database are stored in.
